## Problem 1

```{r}
bday_sim = function(n) {
  
  bdays = sample(1:365, size = n, replace = TRUE)
  
  duplicate = length(unique(bdays)) < n
  
  return(duplicate)
}
```

```{r}
sim_res =
  expand_grid(
    n = 2:50,
    iter = 1:10000
  ) |> 
  mutate(res = map_lgl(n, bday_sim)) |> 
  group_by(n) |> 
  summarize(prob = mean(res))

sim_res |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = n, y = prob)) +
  geom_line()
```

The probability of a shared birthday rises quickly as the group size increases. As the group size approaches 50, the probability becomes close to 1, meaning that it becomes almost certain for larger groups to have at least one shared birthday.
